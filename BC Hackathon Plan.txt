BC Hackathon Plan


Concept: 

Website with "health bar" that is a representation of your current health. 

Health is measured by multiple things that can affect your health, such as your status of your eyes or other body parts. 

Website will be formatted into multiple parts:

1. "health bar"
2. Health recommendations 
3. Links taking you to separate websites that can recommend what you need to do in order to live a healthy lifestyle. 


What will we use?:

Languages: python, javascript, html, css
APIs: Fitbit API, Ozben's project
